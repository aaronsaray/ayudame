# 911 Translation Card

[Dispatch Coach](https://www.dispatchcoach.com/product-page/911-translation-card-magnet) has a great product for those who speak spanish that need to phonetically sound out english to a 911 dispatcher.

I thought it might be nice to have an electronic version of that that someone might keep on their smart phone as a link.  This is a proof of concept of that idea.
